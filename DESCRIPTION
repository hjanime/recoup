Description: recover calculates and plots signal profiles 
    created from short sequence reads derived from Next 
    Generation Sequencing technologies. The profiles 
    provided are either sumarized curve profiles or heatmap
    profiles. Currently, recover supports genomic profile 
    plots for reads derived from ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq 
    experiments. The package uses ggplot2 and ComplexHeatmap
    graphics facilities for curve and heatmap coverage 
    profiles respectively.
